# Research-paper-QA-model

### ðŸ’Ž Overview
Use this code to use Gradle UI where you can ask questions on a research paper you provided. This way you can easily understand everything about the paper.

### ðŸŒˆ Future plans
I want to update the code to add the following functionalities:
- Users don't need to enter the whole research paper text, instead, they should just provide the link to the research paper and I will fetch the paper text
- Update UI to provide a better way to ask multiple questions at once
